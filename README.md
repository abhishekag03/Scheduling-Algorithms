# Scheduling-Algorithms
Coded the following CPU Scheduling Algrithms:  
(1) FIFO  
(2) SJF  
(3) Round robin  
(4) Priority based Scheduling  
(5) Multilevel Queues  
(6) Multilevel Feedback Queues  
Code prints average waiting time and turnaround time for each process.   
Details about implementation can be found in Scheduling_Algorithms.pdf  
Assignment done as a part of Computer Architecture and Operatin Systems Course, Monsoon 2017.
